This project utilizes trail camera footage obtained from 2019-2023 in Idaho, Oregon, and Washington for Snapshot USA. The goal is to become familiar with assessing wildlife presence using trail camera data. Methods used here will help with assessing wildlife data (i.e., trail camera, acoustic recording, point count survey) for my research regarding deadwood quantification using LiDAR and wildlife presence and activity near deadwood structures.
